**First Code**
TASK 1 : **Plasma Temperature Classifier**
Purpose of this task is to classify the temperature of Plasma into three catagories Cold, Warm and Hot.
> This code will ask user for 5 plasma temperature data. 
> Code will classify data using conditional statements and loops.
> Conditional statements will check the given Conditions.
> Code will store data in the list of tuples.
> Will print result according to condition.
> this code can also plot catagory vs teperature plot.

**Second Code**
TASK 2: **Material Properties Lookup**
Purpose:Create a dictionary with materials from materials science then add new material data in dictionary and the calculates highest conductive material and make the density list.
> This code will organise given data into dictionary.
> This code can add new material into excisting dictionary.
> and reprints the data.
> then this code will find highest conductive material.
> after this the code creats the list of densities.

**Third Code**
TASK 4: **Regex Optics Data Clearing**
Purpose: To cleaning the given Data and puting the cleaned data in a list for organising and make the units into sync.
> Take Data from the code itself.
> then use for loop to store all the given values from the list.
> then syncs all the units
> then fill all the taken valuse in a list.
> last Printing the Lists in proper order.
