**First Code**
TASK 1 : **Plasma Temperature Classifier**
Purpose: To classify the Plasma temperatue in three cataguries i.e Cold, Warm and Hot.
on the basis of given conditions 
> This code will ask to user for 5 temperatures (code will check invailed data)
> Classify it using conditional statements and loops
> Conditional statements will check the given Conditions
> Store it in the list of tuples
>   
> Printing

**Second Code**
TASK 3: **Simple Particle Energy Calculator**
Purpose: use kinetic energy formula to calculate energy of the particle
> This code will take some of the data from the user and calucate the energy of the paricle and name and type of the particle in the return.
> first this values will be used to calculate the Kinetic Energy in joule
> then it will convert this energy in electron-volt(eV) using the given formula.
> last print the name of the particle and return the valuse of kinetic energy in both the Units.
> we can also calculate Potential Energy of the system using the formula of Electric-potential -energy.
> We can also make a energy Bar Chart in this program for Bonus Marks.

**Third Code**
TASK 4: **Regex Optics Data Clearing**
Purpose: To cleaning the optical Data and puing in a list to use further thing
> Take Data from the code itself.
> then use for loop to store all the given values from teh list.
> then fill all the taken valuse in a list.
> last Printing the Lists in proper order.
